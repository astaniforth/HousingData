## Undefined Variable Bug in Notebook

**Status: Fixed**
**Date: Dec 2, 2025**
**Commit SHA: 6e2115a**

**Bug Description:**
NameError in run_workflow.ipynb cell: `name 'bad_bins' is not defined`

**Symptoms:**
- Cell execution failed with NameError when trying to filter duplicated BINs
- Code referenced `bad_bins` variable that was never defined in the notebook scope

**Root Cause:**
Code snippet was copied from elsewhere or left incomplete, referencing a variable that should have been defined but wasn't.

**Fix:**
Updated the filtering logic to use the existing `is_bad_bin()` function instead of the undefined `bad_bins` variable. The cell now properly excludes placeholder/bad BINs while showing duplicated ones.

**Code Change:**
```python
# Before (broken):
hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df[
    (hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df["BIN"].duplicated(keep=False)) &
    (~hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df["BIN"].astype(str).isin(bad_bins))
]

# After (fixed):
hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df[
    (hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df["BIN"].duplicated(keep=False)) &
    (~hpd_multifamily_finance_new_construction_df["BIN"].astype(str).apply(is_bad_bin))
]
```

**What is_bad_bin does:**
The `is_bad_bin()` function identifies placeholder BINs by checking for:
- Null/NaN values
- Borough placeholder BINs: '1000000', '2000000', '3000000', '4000000', '5000000'

**Testing:**
- Cell now executes without errors
- No linter errors remain

## BBL Matching Not Working in HPD-DOB Join

**Status: Fixed**
**Date: Dec 2, 2025**
**Commit SHA: 0e75fac**

**Bug Description:**
BBL matching was not working in the HPD-DOB join workflow. The code was only matching on BIN, and the BBL fallback matching was failing.

**Symptoms:**
- BBL matching was not finding matches even when BBLs existed in the DOB data
- Many HPD rows showed NaT (Not a Time) for `earliest_dob_date` even when DOB records existed with matching BBLs
- The code was creating `bbl_str` from only the `bbl` column, ignoring reconstructed BBLs from borough/block/lot

**Root Cause:**
The code in the join cell was creating a new `bbl_str` column from only the `bbl` column using `dob_df['bbl'].apply(...)`. However, `combined_dob_with_normalized_bbl_df` already has a `bbl_normalized` column that includes both:
1. Original `bbl` values (when available)
2. Reconstructed BBLs from borough/block/lot (for BISWEB data that doesn't have a `bbl` column)

By creating `bbl_str` from only the `bbl` column, the code was missing all the reconstructed BBLs, causing BBL matching to fail for records that only had borough/block/lot information.

**Fix:**
Changed the code to use the existing `bbl_normalized` column instead of creating a new `bbl_str` column. Added proper formatting logic to ensure `bbl_normalized` values are always 10-digit zero-padded strings. Also filtered out None/NaN BBLs before grouping to avoid grouping on None values.

**Code Changes:**
1. Replaced `dob_df['bbl_str'] = dob_df['bbl'].apply(...)` with logic that uses `bbl_normalized` if it exists, or creates it from `bbl` as a fallback
2. Added `format_bbl()` function to properly format BBL values (handles int, float, and string types, ensures 10-digit zero-padding)
3. Changed `dob_bbl_min` grouping from `groupby('bbl_str')` to `groupby('bbl_normalized')` with filtering for non-null values: `dob_bin_dates[dob_bin_dates['bbl_normalized'].notna()].groupby(...)`
4. Updated merge statement to rename `bbl_normalized` to `BBL_str` instead of `bbl_str`

**Testing:**
- Code now uses `bbl_normalized` which includes both original and reconstructed BBLs
- BBL matching should now work for records that only have borough/block/lot information
- Proper formatting ensures all BBLs are 10-digit zero-padded strings for consistent matching
