🏗️  HOUSING DATA QUALITY REPORT
================================================================================

📊 DATASET LINEAGE & FILTERING
----------------------------------------
Full HPD Dataset: 691 affordable housing projects
  ↓
Current Working Dataset: 248 projects

📋 Filtering Applied:
  1. Remove confidential projects (redacted for privacy)
  2. Filter to new construction projects only
  3. Include only projects with BINs present
  4. EXCLUDE projects that already have DOB NB/New Building filings

🎯 Result: Projects with BINs but NO DOB permit matches
   These are the 'missing' projects that need permit investigation

📈 Dataset Reduction:
  Full dataset: 691 total projects
  Confidential: 166 (removed for privacy)
  Non-confidential: 525 projects
  BIN-less projects: 0 (excluded)
  New construction with BINs: 0 projects
  Already have DOB filings: -248 projects
  → Working dataset: 248 projects (47.2% of non-confidential)
⏱️  Processing Time: 0.2 seconds
